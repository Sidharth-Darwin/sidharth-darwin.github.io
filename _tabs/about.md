Welcome to my blog! I'm **Sidharth D**, currently preparing for the **GATE 2026** exam. This space is dedicated to sharing my understanding and exploration of topics in **Machine Learning**, **Mathematics**, and **Programming**.

The goal of this blog is to create a focused and structured archive of technical concepts that I'm learning and working through. You'll find posts on algorithms, mathematical foundations, implementation guides, and other related material â€” all centered around building a deeper grasp of ML and its supporting disciplines.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
